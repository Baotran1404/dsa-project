# Color connect

Color Connect is a game built with JS/React/Redux that is all about connecting the dots! Colored dots, that is. Inspired by Flow Free, the player is provided with a board that contains several different colors scattered within it (2 dots of each color). The goal is to draw a path connecting dots of the same color. The player must make sure to adhere to the following rules:

- No paths may overlap
- Every space on the board must be filled (either by a colored dot or a segment of a path)
